# Warehouse-Logistics

This is a program to simulate the flow of goods from factory warehouse where the goods are produced to the other warehouses where these goods are stored. These goods are transferred by trucks which have capacity. The goods are not transferred between factory to warehouse until it is produced in the factory.
